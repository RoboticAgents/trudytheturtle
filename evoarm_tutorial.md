# Tutorial based on the work by teams <Katie and Pallas>, <Rian, Rebekah, Danny>, and <Gary, Zack, Peter>

1. Get a box with a EvoArm in it. Open the box and check its contents. The box should contain the robot arm, few piece of paper with instructions, extra components (screw), gadgets for demos (bricks, etc), and a screw driver.  Look over the papers that were inside the box.

2. Sample code, discussions are on a website called `https://www.evodyneacademy.com/forum/evoarm-apps`. The only way to get in and see the code/discussion is to make an account. That would probably take a day. A trick we used is to use our school email instead of personal email.   

3. Power your robot by plugging it in. Wait for the green light to appear on the raspberry pi, meaning that the robot is ready for you to connect. The number of EvoArmMini that is written on the paper in the bag the SD card comes in corresponds to the number that the hotspot shows. It is also on the sticker on the side of the robot's base. You can also connect to the robot through wifi by navigating to `evoarm.evodyne.co`, entering your robot's access id (the 9 digit number on the white sticker on the robot), and using access code `evodyne2020` to log in to the web interface.

4. Once you access the web interface, turn on the camera. Then, in the 'arm' tab slide the positions to get the robot to move.

**IMPORTANT** If you want to shut off the robot, always make sure to shut it down using the Power menu option on the online app and then wait until the green light on the raspberry pi shuts off before you pull out the wall power. If you do not do this you risk corrupting your SD card data.

5. Now brainstorm ideas. The robot is capable of many things such as lifting certain items, playing tic-tac-toe, moving small objects, etc. You can use sample code on the web interface, on the [evodyneacademy tutorials](https://www.evodyneacademy.com/tutorials), on the [evodyneacademy forum](https://www.evodyneacademy.com/forum/evoarm-apps), or GitHub repository called [EvoArm](https://github.com/AliShug/EvoArm).
